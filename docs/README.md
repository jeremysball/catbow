**catbow** creates rainbow text in a terminal, a super-fast drop-in replacement for [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat).

catbow was created because lolcat's startup time made my terminal painful to open. catbow reduces startup time from 50ms to 2ms (a 25x improvement!)

see docs/BENCHMARK.md for more details
