## TODO
- Fix rainbow logic
## NICE TO TODO
- animated text 
  - lolcat suffers when there are a lack of newlines or very long lines and loses the
    pattern
    lolcat creates a vertical rainbow pattern by incrementing an offset each time it encounters
    a newline. 
  - there are two schools of thought:
    - always increment offset
      - we don't get the rainbow pattern vertically.
      - we do get an unbroken pattern on a single line.
      - I think we would also find that in this scheme newlines
        would be jarring 
    - only increment on newlines
      - issue stated aboved
      - we do get a nice rainbow pattern in what I imagine is the majority of
      usecases (and my usecase)

      I think we can likely get the best of both worlds by doing 2 until we see
      that our line is bigger than a maximum and then we can switch strategies and
      redraw the entire line 

COLORS:

support for [various types](https://gist.github.com/kurahaupo/6ce0eaefe5e730841f03cb82b061daa2) of escape codes will be detected (TODO: how?) (--color-mode <truecolor | 256col | 16col> to override):
- 256 color palette ONLY
- 16 color palette ONLY 
  references:
  - [ANSI escape list](https://gist.github.com/JBlond/2fea43a3049b38287e5e9cefc87b2124)
  - [ANSI visualization](https://github.com/fidian/ansi)
CLI:
  - Cobra for argument parsing
  - automatically generate shell completions via build system 
  - package shell completions*
  - flags:
      --no-color
      -a, --animate
      -D, --duration (how long each segment animates for)
### lolcat Feature Parity Todo
- ability to interleave files and stdin: `catbow file0 - file1`* 
- when we are in a tty (our stdin is attached to a terminal) AND no files AND
  there is no stdin THEN we will allow the user to type into the terminal, buffer
  the text, and print rainbow text when they hit enter
